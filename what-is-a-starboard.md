# What is a Starboard?

#### Simple explanation: Starboard is like democratic pins.

A starboard allows users to react on a message with ⭐️ and send the message to a \#starboard channel once it gets enough ⭐️'s. There's no limit to how many messages can be starred.

If 3 people react on a message with ⭐️, the bot will copy the message over to a starboard channel.

This Starboard bot aims to make starboard as fun as possible, with rewards on stars, leaderboards, hall of fame, and so much more!
