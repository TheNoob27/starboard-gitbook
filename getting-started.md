# Getting Started

#### To setup the bot, the first thing you should do is run `star setup`.

This command will run you through all the basic settings for the server. Follow the instructions to setup the server.

For each setting, you should respond with what you want the setting to be set as. 

{% hint style="info" %}
You can **skip**, **cancel** or **end** the setup at any time by saying "skip", "cancel" or "end".
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Once done, you can view the rest of the customisable settings with `star settings`
{% endhint %}



If you don't want the prefix as `star` , you can change the prefix with `star prefix set <[prefix]>`, or add a new prefix with `star prefixes add <[prefix]>`.
