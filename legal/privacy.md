# Privacy

Starboard does **not** store information about you or the messages you send, without your permission.

### Recap - What is Starboard?

Starboard is a bot that allows messages to be "starred" or highlighted, and messages get sent to a separate channel once they get a lot of star reactions from members of your server.



### What data does the bot handle?

The bot can access the content of messages, only because it is necessary for the purpose of displaying the message content back to the server members, in the starboard channel you've set it to. Without server members adding reactions, modifying messages or interacting with the bot via commands, nothing is happening in relation to your server, without your consent.

User data, member data, roles, reactions, emojis, and of course messages, are in use by the bot but only for your own experience, for starboard messages, customisation and tracking valid reactions.



### What data does the bot store?

Nothing the bot stores can be traced back to sensitive data - without your consent, the only thing we store are IDs of users, channels and messages. No usernames are stored, no nicknames are stored, the IDs are the only thing used to identify users and messages.

With your consent, however, you can opt into allowing the bot save messages once they get deleted - this behaviour is enabled by disabling an in-bot setting called **LinkDeletes**. (When enabled - which it is by default - starboard messages will get deleted automatically when the original message it represents is deleted.) When this setting is disabled, messages are **encrypted** and saved for a max of **30** days, in case the layout of the starboard message needs to be changed or resent, or other similar reasons.



### Who can view my messages?

By default, only you and your server members can view your messages. But, a server that isn't age-restricted can opt into having their messages appear in a global random starboard message command called **star explore**. This command brings up a random message from a server that has the in-bot **Visible** setting enabled. A üåç globe shows you that the message has been found in the **star explore** command, followed by how many times it has been found.

There's also a global servers leaderboard, viewable by running the command **star leaderboard servers** - servers are listed by name. Permission for your server to appear on this leaderboard is determined by the same in-bot setting, **Visible**.

The owner of Starboard will never view your starred messages or information about your server, unless asked for help or given permission to do so.
