# Changing the Emoji

{% hint style="warning" %}
To change the emoji, you need to [vote for the bot](https://top.gg/bot/655390915325591629/vote).
{% endhint %}

To change the emoji used to star messages, you can run `star changesetting emoji reaction <[emoji]>`

{% hint style="info" %}
The emoji can be a default emoji like ⭐️ or a custom emoji from a server the bot is in.
{% endhint %}

### And that's it!

That emoji is now the emoji used to star messages. It's that simple.
