# Filters

## What are Filters?

Filters are an easy way to limit what type of messages can be starred, from limiting the age of the messages to limiting the length of the messages. Filters can optionally apply to only a subset of users, so you have a better control of what can be starred. You can also create Filters under channel settings, so they only apply to specific channels!

Messages cannot be starred if they don't pass every filter. If a message has been starred before filters were made, or forced to the starboard, they'll still be able to get more stars.
