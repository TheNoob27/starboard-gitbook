# Deleting Channel Settings

To delete channel settings, just do `star channelsettings delete <[name]>`. `name` can be either a channel that belongs to channel settings, or a channel settings name.

{% hint style="danger" %}
By deleting channel settings, you'll lose all saved reward roles, blacklists/whitelists, filters and other saved configurations, and they'll be gone forever.
{% endhint %}
